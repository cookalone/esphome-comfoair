# ComfoAir
Port of the ComfoAir protocol to ESPHome.io firmware, which is supported by external_components.

Add the following definition of `external_components` to your yaml configuration:

```
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/cookalone/esphome-comfoair
    components: [comfoair]
```
and then use it:
```
